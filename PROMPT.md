# Prompt

Add functionality to the image carousel by writing Javascript, and modifying/adding HTML and CSS.

## Functionality

1. Arrow buttons should advance the slide to the previous or next image.
   -> If the user is on the first image and clicks the left arrow button, they should go to the last image.
   -> If the user is on the last image and clicks the right arrow button, they should go to the first image.

2. When the user clicks on an indicator button (the six dashes), it should take them to the corresponding slide.
   -> If the user clicks the left or right arrow buttons afterwards, it should move to the previous or next slide accordingly.

3. Add unique styling to the indicator buttons to indicate which slide is currently showing.

- Upon the first load, the app should display the first slide. There are a total of 6 slides-the current one showing is the 6th slide.
